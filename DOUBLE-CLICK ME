   NOTE: client is preconfigured for your hardware configuration;
         however, if you have a 24-thread machine that won't meet
         bigadv deadlines (ask us, if you're not sure), you will
         have to answer 'yes' to 'Change advanced options' question
         and remove '-bigadv' parameter from 'Additional client
