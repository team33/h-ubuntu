Welcome to [H] Ubuntu Folding Appliance [version 9] !


To complete installation:

1. Open a terminal:
   (a) click on the Dash Icon (top-left), then
   (b) type: 'terminal' and press Enter

2. In the terminal window, type: 'sudo fahinstall' (remove quotes)
   and press Enter.

3. After few moments, fahinstall will ask if you accept Folding@Home
   EULA. If you accept the EULA, press Enter.

4. Fahinstall will then download and run the client in -configonly mode
   which will ask you for your donor name, team number and passkey.
   Enter the values as requested.

   If you don't have a passkey, request one at:
   http://fah-web.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/getpasskey.py

   Add'l passkey info is available at:
   http://folding.stanford.edu/English/FAQ-passkey

5. You may leave remaining items at their defaults (Press Enter to
   accept each value). If you wish to use Langouste answer 'yes'
   to 'Use proxy' question.

   NOTE: client is preconfigured for your hardware configuration;
         however, if you have a 24-thread machine that won't meet
         bigadv deadlines (ask us, if you're not sure), you will
         have to answer 'yes' to 'Change advanced options' question
         and remove '-bigadv' parameter from 'Additional client
         parameters' list.

6. Upon completing the installation, fahinstall will print your host
   name and IP address and will ask you to reboot the machine.

7. Optionally, you may now change host name to your liking. To do so,
   type:

       sudo hostname-persistent <hostname>

   Replace <hostname> with desired name and press Enter.

   For instance, to set your hostname to 'neptune' type:

       sudo hostname-persistent neptune

   and press Enter.

8. Reboot the machine: type 'sudo reboot' (remove quotes) and press
   Enter

9. Once the machine reboots, log back in.

10. To start folding, open a terminal and type (press Enter after each
    line):

       cd ~/fah/
       ./fah6
